## Design Resources

### Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/team/723108805461676473/project/295910746) is a collaborative design and prototyping tool. It's the heart of the design process, allowing designers to work together seamlessly.

- **Get Access**: If you're not already part of the Figma project, request access from the project lead or manager.

### Coding Standards

Maintaining a consistent code style is essential for collaborative development. Our coding standards document will guide you on best practices.

### Version Control

We use Git for version control. Make sure you have Git installed and are familiar with its basics.

### Development Tools

Your development environment is critical. Here are some tools and resources to help you set up your workspace:

- **Code Editor**: We use both [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Install one of these editors to work on the project.
- **Package Manager**: [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is the package manager we use for JavaScript projects. Install it to manage project dependencies.
